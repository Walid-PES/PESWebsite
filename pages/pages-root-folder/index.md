        <p>We offer an affordable solution that addresses both the problem of plastic waste and the housing shortage. Through extensive experimentation we've discovered a perfect mix of plastic waste, sand and gravel; and developed an energy efficient, modular and highly scalable technology for producing building materials. This is a way to recover resources from the waste and produce sustainable buildings with positive ecological and social impact. <a href="/p2b/"><strong>{{ site.data.language.read_more }}</strong></a></p>
